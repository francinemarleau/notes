    "## Event handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Reacting to events in wxPython is called event handling. An event is when \"something\" happens on your application (a button click, text input, mouse movement, etc). Much of GUI programming consists of responding to events. You bind an object to an event using the Bind() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MainWindow(wx.Frame):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, parent, title):\n",
    "        wx.Frame.__init__(self,parent, title=title, size=(200,100))\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        menuItem = filemenu.Append(wx.ID_ABOUT, \"&About\",\" Information about this program\")\n",
    "        self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.OnAbout, menuItem)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, from now on, when the user selects the \"About\" menu item, the method self.OnAbout will be executed. wx.EVT_MENU is the \"select menu item\" event. wxWidgets understands many other events (see the full list\n",
    "at https://wiki.wxpython.org/ListOfEvents). The self.OnAbout method has the general declaration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   def OnAbout(self, event):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here event is an instance of a subclass of wx.Event. For example, a button-click event - wx.EVT_BUTTON - is a subclass of wx.Event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is executed when the event occurs. By default, this method will handle the event and the event will stop after the callback finishes. However, you can \"skip\" an event with event.Skip(). This causes the event to go through the hierarchy of event handlers. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def OnButtonClick(self, event):\n",
    "    if (some_condition):\n",
    "        do_something()\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        event.Skip()\n",
    "\n",
    "def OnEvent(self, event):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "When a button-click event occurs, the method OnButtonClick gets called. If some_condition is true, we do_something() otherwise we let the event be handled by the more general event handler. Now let's have a look at our application:\n"

    "\n",
    "### Laying out Visual Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a frame, you'll use a number of wxWindow sub-classes to flesh out the frame's contents. Here are some of the more common elements you might want to put in your frame:\n",
    "- wx.MenuBar, which puts a menu bar along the top of your frame.\n",
    "- wx.StatusBar, which sets up an area along the bottom of your frame for displaying status messages, etc.\n",
    "- wx.ToolBar, which puts a toolbar in your frame.\n",
    "- Sub-classes of wx.Control. These are objects which represent user interface widgets (ie, visual elements which display data and/or process user input). Common examples of wx.Control objects include wx.Button, wx.StaticText, wx.TextCtrl and wx.ComboBox.\n",
    "- wx.Panel, which is a container to hold your various wx.Control objects. Putting your wx.Control objects inside a wx.Panel means that the user can tab from one UI widget to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "All visual elements (wxWindow objects and their subclasses) can hold sub-elements. Thus, for example, a wx.Frame might hold a number of wx.Panel objects, which in turn hold a number of wx.Button, wx.StaticText and wx.TextCtrl objects, giving you an entire hierarchy of elements: ￼ Note that this merely describes the way that certain visual elements are interrelated -- not how they are visually laid out within the frame. To handle the layout of elements within a frame, there are several options.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to show the usage of wxSizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sizer (that is, one of the wx.Sizer sub-classes) can be used to handle the visual arrangement of elements within a window or frame. Sizers can:\n",
    "- Calculate an appropriate size for each visual element.\n",
    "- Position the elements according to certain rules.\n",
    "- Dynamically resize and/or reposition elements when a frame is resized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the more common types of sizers include:\n",
    "- wx.BoxSizer, which arranges visual elements in a line going either horizontally or vertically.\n",
    "- wx.GridSizer, which lays visual elements out into a grid-like structure.\n",
    "- wx.FlexGridSizer, which is similar to a wx.GridSizer except that it allow for more flexibility in laying out visual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sizer is given a list of wx.Window objects to size, either by calling sizer.Add(window, options...), or by calling sizer.AddMany(...). A sizer will only work on those elements which it has been given. Sizers can be nested. That is, you can add one sizer to another sizer, for example to have two rows of buttons (each laid out by a horizontal wx.BoxSizer) contained within another wx.BoxSizer which places the rows of buttons one above the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Notice that the above example does not lay out the six buttons into two rows of three columns each -- to do that, you should use a wxGridSizer.\n",
    "In the following example we use two nested sizers, the main one with vertical layout and the embedded one with horizontal layout:\n",

    "The sizer.Add method has three arguments. The first one specifies the control to include in the sizer. The second one is a weight factor which means that this control will be sized in proportion to other ones. For example, if you had three edit controls and you wanted them to have the proportions 3:2:1 then you would specify these factors as arguments when adding the controls. 0 means that this control or sizer will not grow. The third argument is normally wx.GROW (same as wx.EXPAND) which means the control will be resized when necessary. If you use wx.SHAPED instead, the controls aspect ratio will remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the second parameter is 0, i.e. the control will not be resized, the third parameter may indicate if the control should be centered horizontally and/or vertically by using wx.ALIGN_CENTER_HORIZONTAL, wx.ALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL, or wx.ALIGN_CENTER (for both) instead of wx.GROW or wx.SHAPED as that third parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can alternatively specify combinations of wx.ALIGN_LEFT, wx.ALIGN_TOP, wx.ALIGN_RIGHT, and wx.ALIGN_BOTTOM. The default behavior is equivalent to wx.ALIGN_LEFT | wx.ALIGN_TOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potentially confusing aspect of the wx.Sizer and its sub-classes is the distinction between a sizer and a parent window. When you create objects to go inside a sizer, you do not make the sizer the object's parent window. A sizer is a way of laying out windows, it is not a window in itself. In the above example, all six buttons would be created with the parent window being the frame or window which encloses the buttons -- not the sizer. If you try to create a visual element and pass the sizer as the parent window, your program will crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have set up your visual elements and added them to a sizer (or to a nested set of sizers), the next step is to tell your frame or window to use the sizer. You do this in three steps:\n",

And finally, the call to sizer.Fit() tells the sizer to calculate the initial size and position for all its elements. If you are using sizers, this is the normal process you would go through to set up your window or frame's contents before it is displayed for the first time.\n"

    "For example: If the user presses the \"Clear\" button and that clears the text field, that will generate an EVT_TEXT event, but not an EVT_CHAR event.\n",
